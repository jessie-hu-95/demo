* Demo for the problem

Normally, there is no need for a =pyrightconfig.json= file to exist.
We only need a venv and =.git= to let Emacs' version control know the
root directory of the project.

To reproduce the problem, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a venv in the root directory of this project by
   #+begin_src shell
     python -m venv venv
   #+end_src
3. Restart Emacs.
4. Use =C-x p e= or =C-x p p e= to start an Eshell buffer, and execute
   #+begin_src shell
     which python
   #+end_src
   this would say the python executable is in the some system =bin=
   directory.
5. Do =C-x p e= or =C-x p p e= again, and execute the same command.
   Eshell would say python is located at the =bin= directory in the
   venv.
